**Chronology:**
Late Archaic (c. 3000 – 1000 BCE)

**Distribution:**
Primarily found in western and central New York State, with related forms extending into Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes region.

**Description:**
Lamoka points are small, triangular, and thin, typically measuring 2–4 cm in length. The base is concave, often with pronounced ears. Flaking is usually fine and regular, producing a flat cross‑section. Materials are predominantly local cherts and quartzites, though Onondaga chert is common in western New York. Hafting was likely accomplished with a split‑socket or side‑notched configuration, though true notches are rare. The points are interpreted as tips for darts propelled with atlatls.
