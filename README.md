# New York State Lithic Projectile Point Guide

A collaborative, open-access guide to lithic projectile point types of New York State, maintained by the New York State Archaeological Association (NYSAA) community.

## Purpose

This guide aims to provide a standardized digital reference for avocational and professional archaeologists, students, and enthusiasts studying the material culture of New York State. Each entry follows a consistent template to ensure clarity and comparability across point types.

2. **Create an Issue**: If not, open a new issue describing the point type you'd like to add, including any relevant references or images.
3. **Follow the Template**: Use the [`TEMPLATE.md`](point-types/TEMPLATE.md) file in the `point-types` directory as the basis for your entry.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Fork the repository (if you're not a direct collaborator)
   - Create a new branch for your addition
   - Add your new Markdown file following the naming convention `point-type-name.md`
